**Task**

Develop a program (in a language of your choice) that analyses a sentence that contains several words without punctuation. When a word in that sentence is input, the program identifies all of the positions where the word occurs in the sentence.

The system should not be case sensitive: Do, do, DO should be treated as the same word.

For example, in the sentence

DO NOT JUDGE ME BY MY SUCCESSES
JUDGE ME BY HOW MANY TIMES I FELL DOWN AND GOT BACK UP AGAIN.

The word ‘JUDGE’ occurs in the 3rd and 8th positions.

Your program can discard punctuation.
Ensure you have commented each line of the code to explain how your program works.
Once you have completed the program file upload it to Google Classroom

Useful Tips

You will probably need some type of input() statement

You will need to check through each item in the sentence maybe using a loop

You might want to research the following methods enumerate(), find()
